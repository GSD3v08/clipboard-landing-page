## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned a little more about grid and flexbox, I got confused sometimes becasuse I had to think when to use them.

### Continued development

Keep making projects until I get confortable using flexbox and grid together.
